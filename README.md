# TunesBeDope 🎼

TunesBeDope is a small website that lets users search for their favorite artist/song and populates the top artists/songs related to their search as well as provide a music video matching their search query. On top of it, they'll get lyrics of said song beneath the video/song.

To use, just type in enter your desired artist + song and click the search button, the page will load a list of options for you to click on, which will load the video below.

## Quirks 🎯

TunesBeDope will remember past searches!

If the video doesn't load, you'll get a direct link to the video to watch it in YouTube directly.

LYRICS!!! They'll be below the video (tablet/phone) or next to it (full size)
